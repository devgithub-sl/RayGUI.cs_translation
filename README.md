*
*   raygui v5.0 - A simple and easy-to-use immediate-mode gui library
*
*   DESCRIPTION:
*       raygui is a tools-dev-focused immediate-mode-gui library based on raylib but also
*       available as a standalone library, as long as input and drawing functions are provided
*
*   FEATURES:
*       - Immediate-mode gui, minimal retained data
*       - +25 controls provided (basic and advanced)
*       - Styling system for colors, font and metrics
*       - Icons supported, embedded as a 1-bit icons pack
*       - Standalone mode option (custom input/graphics backend)
*       - Multiple support tools provided for raygui development
*
*   POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
*       - Better standalone mode API for easy plug of custom backends
*       - Externalize required inputs, allow user easier customization
*
*   LIMITATIONS:
*       - No editable multi-line word-wraped text box supported
*       - No auto-layout mechanism, up to the user to define controls position and size
*       - Standalone mode requires library modification and some user work to plug another backend
*
*   NOTES:
*       - WARNING: GuiLoadStyle() and GuiLoadStyle{Custom}() functions, allocate memory for
*         font atlas recs and glyphs, freeing that memory is (usually) up to the user,
*         no unload function is explicitly provided... but note that GuiLoadStyleDefault() unloads
*         by default any previously loaded font (texture, recs, glyphs)
*       - Global UI alpha (guiAlpha) is applied inside GuiDrawRectangle() and GuiDrawText() functions
*
*   CONTROLS PROVIDED:
*     # Container/separators Controls
*       - WindowBox     --> StatusBar, Panel
*       - GroupBox      --> Line
*       - Line
*       - Panel         --> StatusBar
*       - ScrollPanel   --> StatusBar
*       - TabBar        --> Button
*
*     # Basic Controls
*       - Label
*       - LabelButton   --> Label
*       - Button
*       - Toggle
*       - ToggleGroup   --> Toggle
*       - ToggleSlider
*       - CheckBox
*       - ComboBox
*       - DropdownBox
*       - TextBox
*       - ValueBox      --> TextBox
*       - Spinner       --> Button, ValueBox
*       - Slider
*       - SliderBar     --> Slider
*       - ProgressBar
*       - StatusBar
*       - DummyRec
*       - Grid
*
*     # Advance Controls
*       - ListView
*       - ColorPicker   --> ColorPanel, ColorBarHue
*       - MessageBox    --> Window, Label, Button
*       - TextInputBox  --> Window, Label, TextBox, Button
*
*     It also provides a set of functions for styling the controls based on its properties (size, color)
*
*
*   RAYGUI STYLE (guiStyle):
*       raygui uses a global data array for all gui style properties (allocated on data segment by default),
*       when a new style is loaded, it is loaded over the global style... but a default gui style could always be
*       recovered with GuiLoadStyleDefault() function, that overwrites the current style to the default one
*
*       The global style array size is fixed and depends on the number of controls and properties:
*
*           static unsigned int guiStyle[RAYGUI_MAX_CONTROLS*(RAYGUI_MAX_PROPS_BASE + RAYGUI_MAX_PROPS_EXTENDED)];
*
*       guiStyle size is by default: 16*(16 + 8) = 384 int = 384*4 bytes = 1536 bytes = 1.5 KB
*
*       Note that the first set of BASE properties (by default guiStyle[0..15]) belong to the generic style
*       used for all controls, when any of those base values is set, it is automatically populated to all
*       controls, so, specific control values overwriting generic style should be set after base values
*
*       After the first BASE properties set, the EXTENDED properties set is defined (by default guiStyle[16..23]),
*       those properties are actually common to all controls and can not be overwritten individually (like BASE ones)
*       Some of those properties are: TEXT_SIZE, TEXT_SPACING, LINE_COLOR, BACKGROUND_COLOR
*
*       Custom control properties can be defined using the EXTENDED properties for each independent control.
*
*       TOOL: rGuiStyler is a visual tool to customize raygui style: github.com/raysan5/rguistyler
*
*
*   RAYGUI ICONS (guiIcons):
*       raygui could use a global array containing icons data (allocated on data segment by default),
*       a custom icons set could be loaded over this array using GuiLoadIcons(), but loaded icons set
*       must be same RAYGUI_ICON_SIZE and no more than RAYGUI_ICON_MAX_ICONS will be loaded
*
*       Every icon is codified in binary form, using 1 bit per pixel, so, every 16x16 icon
*       requires 8 integers (16*16/32) to be stored in memory.
*
*       When the icon is draw, actually one quad per pixel is drawn if the bit for that pixel is set
*
*       The global icons array size is fixed and depends on the number of icons and size:
*
*           static unsigned int guiIcons[RAYGUI_ICON_MAX_ICONS*RAYGUI_ICON_DATA_ELEMENTS];
*
*       guiIcons size is by default: 256*(16*16/32) = 2048*4 = 8192 bytes = 8 KB
*
*       TOOL: rGuiIcons is a visual tool to customize/create raygui icons: github.com/raysan5/rguiicons
*
*   RAYGUI LAYOUT:
*       raygui currently does not provide an auto-layout mechanism like other libraries,
*       layouts must be defined manually on controls drawing, providing the right bounds Rectangle for it
*
*       TOOL: rGuiLayout is a visual tool to create raygui layouts: github.com/raysan5/rguilayout
*
*   CONFIGURATION:
*       #define RAYGUI_IMPLEMENTATION
*           Generates the implementation of the library into the included file
*           If not defined, the library is in header only mode and can be included in other headers
*           or source files without problems. But only ONE file should hold the implementation
*
*       #define RAYGUI_STANDALONE
*           Avoid raylib.h header inclusion in this file. Data types defined on raylib are defined
*           internally in the library and input management and drawing functions must be provided by
*           the user (check library implementation for further details)
*
*       #define RAYGUI_NO_ICONS
*           Avoid including embedded ricons data (256 icons, 16x16 pixels, 1-bit per pixel, 2KB)
*
*       #define RAYGUI_CUSTOM_ICONS
*           Includes custom ricons.h header defining a set of custom icons,
*           this file can be generated using rGuiIcons tool
*
*       #define RAYGUI_DEBUG_RECS_BOUNDS
*           Draw control bounds rectangles for debug
*
*       #define RAYGUI_DEBUG_TEXT_BOUNDS
*           Draw text bounds rectangles for debug

*
*   DEPENDENCIES:
*       raylib 5.6-dev  - Inputs reading (keyboard/mouse), shapes drawing, font loading and text drawing
*
*   STANDALONE MODE:
*       By default raygui depends on raylib mostly for the inputs and the drawing functionality but that dependency can be disabled
*       with the config flag RAYGUI_STANDALONE. In that case is up to the user to provide another backend to cover library needs
*
*       The following functions should be redefined for a custom backend:
*
*           - Vector2 GetMousePosition(void);
*           - float GetMouseWheelMove(void);
*           - bool IsMouseButtonDown(int button);
*           - bool IsMouseButtonPressed(int button);
*           - bool IsMouseButtonReleased(int button);
*           - bool IsKeyDown(int key);
*           - bool IsKeyPressed(int key);
*           - int GetCharPressed(void);         // -- GuiTextBox(), GuiValueBox()
*
*           - void DrawRectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height, Color color); // -- GuiDrawRectangle()
*           - void DrawRectangleGradientEx(Rectangle rec, Color col1, Color col2, Color col3, Color col4); // -- GuiColorPicker()
*
*           - Font GetFontDefault(void);                            // -- GuiLoadStyleDefault()
*           - Font LoadFontEx(const char *fileName, int fontSize, int *codepoints, int codepointCount); // -- GuiLoadStyle()
*           - Texture2D LoadTextureFromImage(Image image);          // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to load texture from embedded font atlas image
*           - void SetShapesTexture(Texture2D tex, Rectangle rec);  // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to set shapes rec to font white rec (optimization)
*           - char *LoadFileText(const char *fileName);             // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to load charset data
*           - void UnloadFileText(char *text);                      // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to unload charset data
*           - const char *GetDirectoryPath(const char *filePath);   // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to find charset/font file from text .rgs
*           - int *LoadCodepoints(const char *text, int *count);    // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to load required font codepoints list
*           - void UnloadCodepoints(int *codepoints);               // -- GuiLoadStyle(), required to unload codepoints list
*           - unsigned char *DecompressData(const unsigned char *compData, int compDataSize, int *dataSize); // -- GuiLoadStyle()
